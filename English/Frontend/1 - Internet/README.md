- **Brief Explanation of the Concept:**  
  A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a website instead of using its IP address. Domain Name Systems (DNS) translate these names into IP addresses so that devices can communicate with web servers.
- **Main Concept:**  
  Domain names allow users to access websites easily, rather than using long IP addresses. DNS acts like a directory, converting domain names to IP addresses to connect users with websites.
- **Pareto Principle:**  
  The 20% most relevant points include:
  1. A domain name is a human-friendly address for a website.
  2. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.
  3. Users interact with domain names instead of IP addresses.
- **Analogy or Mental Model:**  
  A domain name is like a contact in your phone. Instead of remembering the phone number (IP), you just use the saved name (domain) to make the call.
- **Flashcards/Study Notes:**
  1. **Q:** What is a domain name?  
     **A:** A human-friendly address that identifies a website.
  2. **Q:** What does DNS translate?  
     **A:** Domain names into IP addresses.
  3. **Q:** Why is a domain name useful?  
     **A:** It’s easier to remember than an IP address.
  4. **Q:** What system translates domain names?  
     **A:** The Domain Name System (DNS).
  5. **Q:** What does a domain name represent to a user?
